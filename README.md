# Dice Roll Reader #

Companion app for [https://github.com/michael-land/Dice-Android-Kotlin](https://github.com/michael-land/Dice-Android-Kotlin). Dice-Android-Kotlin is an app that allows a user to roll a dice. Additionally, if a user logs in on Dice-Android-Kotlin, each roll will be recorded and sent to a Firebase database.

This app allows a user to log in and synchronously view the dice rolls for their account; if someone is logged into the companion app on a different phone, this app will allow them (or someone else) to view those rolls as they happen.
